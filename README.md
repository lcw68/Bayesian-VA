# Joint Bayes framework for cell type specific differential analysis
The main function to estimate the parameter is incorporated in variationalfunction.R, while weighted_vem.R contains the function to incorporate weighted likelihood.
hessian_update.R writes the function for hypothesis testing in variational approximation framework. run_VEM shows an example to run the model on the simulation data.
